  Biome is a Design System for HDB’s Intranet System. It details a collection of
  reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together
  to build any number of applications. It is the source of truth for these
  components and standards.

<p className="body">
  The Biome Figma Library targets the <span className="emphasis">Design</span>{" "}
  half of the Design System, serving as an important reference and tool for
  designers designing new pages for the Intranet System. It documents the design
  of a collection of components and styles, why and how to use these assets, and
  supports the creation of new page designs efficiently and effectively.
</p>
<p className="body">
  The Figma Library supports designers of all proficiencies through tutorials,
  example pages and a compilation of best practices. Previously designed pages
  and prototypes will continue to be included. Understanding not only the what,
  but the why, behind the design of a system is critical to creating an
  exceptional user experience. The Figma Library is crafted with this principle
  kept strongly in mind.

<h5 className="h5">Biome Documentation</h5>

<p className="body">You are looking at the Biome Documentation right now.</p>
<p className="body">
  The Biome Documentation is the{" "}
  <span className="emphasis">bridge between the Design and Development</span>{" "}
  halves of the Design System, serving as a tool that links the Figma and React
  libraries and for both designers and developers to better communicate their
  ideas. It allows designers to work with live UI components in a simplified
  playground, interacting with them as they would appear in a finalised web
  application. It supports developers in visualising what the components look
  like based on different input parameters, provides clear and lucid
  documentation on how to use these components with the React Library, and
  converts the displayed UI components into source code for immediate use.
</p>
<p className="body">
  There can be a huge gulf between the design and development phase, because
  communication between the designer and developer can end up more complicated
  and confusing than necessary. The Documentation mediates this stage of
  communication, and facilitate the process in which developers can develop
  pages from designs.
</p>
<p className="body">The main sections in the Documentation are:</p>

  <li className="body">Introduction</li>
  <li className="body">How To Use</li>
  <li className="body">Design System</li>

<h5 className="h5">Biome React Library</h5>
<img

  alt="Screenshot of React Library"
  className="diagram pb-1"
/>
<p className="body">
  The Biome React Library is key to the{" "}
  <span className="emphasis">Development</span> half of the Design System,
  serving as an interfacing library of React components for developers to import
  and use through props. It scopes down the usage of each component to limited
  props, which ensures consistency across the board. Components will manage
  state internally, supporting usage through abstracted data structures. This
  feature reduces overlapping code and enables developers to develop working web
  applications more easily and quickly.
</p>
<p className="body">
  A UI Library like Material UI provides too many options for customisability
  and requires developers to write functions to manage the state of the
  components, leading to visual UI differences and unnecessary overlapping code
  across development teams. The Biome React Library solves these issues and
  streamlines the entire development workflow.
</p>

<h4 className="h4">Behind Biome</h4>

<h5 className="h5">Why Do We Need Biome?</h5>
<p className="body">
  Biome brings order to chaos. When Intranet System application teams work in
  silos, attention is not being paid to the workflows that cut across the
  groups’ responsibilities. It is not optimal for HDB Intranet teams to build
  redundant designs and code or for HDB Staff to interact with inconsistent
  designs.
</p>
<p className="body">
  Biome represents a shared vision for the future of the Intranet System.
  Through a shared set of principles, patterns, and components, it becomes
  feasible to create consistent experiences across different systems. This
  consistency means that systems become more learnable as well. Because the
  designs are based on usability guidelines and user research, systems pick up
  optimised usability simply by adopting Biome. Instead of repeatedly building
  similar components from scratch, Biome enables designers and developers to
  reuse components and thereby increase efficiency. The increased efficiency and
  consistency lead HDB to build faster products at scale.

    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p className="body">
  <span className="emphasis">Independent</span>
  <br />
  For Biome to be truly useful, it should be usable without any briefing. Once
  you open any part of the system, it should be so clear to the user how exactly
  they can go about working with Biome. Biome should stand alone independently.
  And in the process of using it, Biome should equip users with the principles,
  knowledge, and tools to solve problems without the Biome Team. It is much more
  fulfilling when Biome strives to inspire the approach to solving problems
  rather than just being a catalog. Any user should be able to navigate Biome
  with ease, even if they have varying degrees of familiarity to the tools used
  (e.g. Figma). This doesn’t mean that Biome won’t be using the best
  technologies the tools have to offer, but instead that the system will guide
  users to become confident in utilising such technologies.
</p>
<p className="body">
  <span className="emphasis">Coherent</span>
  <br />
  The components in Biome and the examples that shown should direct designers to
  make their pages in a way that coheres with the shared design vision without
  having to read and follow a long grocery list of rulesets. Following Biome
  guidelines should be the most efficient and intuitive route, so then by taking
  the easiest path, the design will already be consistent and cohesive. Also,
  Biome should show best practices with real examples. It’s significantly easier
  to adopt, understand, update, maintain and implement from examples rather than
  just parts.
</p>
<p className="body">
  <span className="emphasis">Organic</span>
  <br />
  Biome should organically adapt to team needs. Think of the design system more
  as a toolbox, rather than an instruction manual. The system should empower and
  support users, not frustrate them or to make them feel restricted. Biome will
  take in user feedback and research consistently to grow the design system.
  Biome should never be set in stone. It should grow and change based on current
  team needs. If a component, pattern, or best practice no longer makes sense,
  it should be changed.
</p>

<div className="pb-1" />

<h5 className="h5">Atomic Design</h5>
<img
  src={AtomicDesign}
  alt="Diagram representing Atomic Design"
  className="diagram pb-1"
/>
<p className="body">
  Biome is based on Atomic Design. Atomic elements, like a colour palette or a
  text field, come together to form molecules, like a group of checkboxes
  forming one question. These molecules are strung together to form organisms,
  for example a form template that designers can easily adapt to fit their
  needs. Biome essentially holds this group of organisms, of molecules, of atoms
  that is very modular, so designers can easily construct new molecules or
  organisms that you need. It’s very reusable. If a change is made to a
  component on an atomic level, it will be applied across the whole system, so
  it’s very adaptable as well.
</p>
<p className="body">
  Biome is also heavily based on Material UI because teams are currently working
  with Material UI and React as their front-end framework, making the adoption
  of our design system smoother. Basing Biome on an existing system also
  provides a good foundation.
</p>

<div className="pb-1" />

<h5 className="h5">Why Biome?</h5>
<p className="body">
  As the first Biome Team was working on this design system, the name Biome came
  to mind so quickly. Because this design system is essentially a collection of
  organisms, as per Atomic Design, it makes perfect sense to call it Biome, a
  collection of organisms. The name Biome neatly represents the principles, it’s
  an environment in which users are empowered to make the designs they want to,
  and yet that the designs will naturally cohere. Importantly, Biome strongly
  connotes this quality of organic growth that the team keeps talking about. We
  want Biome to be a co-construction between us and the users. It’s not a dead,
  fixed, rigid design system, but rather a living, breathing one that takes into
  account the many different needs of the various applications in the Intranet
  System.
</p>

<div className="pb-1" />

<h5 className="h5">Notes from the Biome Team</h5>
<p className="body">
  Because Biome organically grows and changes, passing from hand to hand, each
  team will leave a little indelible mark on it. And in this section, teams get
  to pen down their thoughts as they hand over the project.
</p>

<p className="body small left-indent">
  we are incredibly heartened to have the opportunity to create Biome in our
  internship! we hope that Biome will continue to thrive and grow and reshape
  the Intranet System for the better.
